# Data Analysis with Python (freeCodeCamp Projects)
This is a set of projects which will be helpful in learning the fundamentals of data analysis with Python. 

You'll be reading data from CSV files, process that data using NumPy and Pandas, and visualize it using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

These tasks were taken from [freeCodeCamp Data Analysis Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/).
